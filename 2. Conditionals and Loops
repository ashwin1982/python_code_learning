if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero

Problem4:
Fahrenheit to Celsius
Send Feedback
Given three values - Start Fahrenheit Value (S), End Fahrenheit value (E) and Step Size (W), you need to convert all Fahrenheit values from Start to End at the gap of W, into their corresponding Celsius values and print the table.
Input Format :
3 integers - S, E and W respectively 
Output Format :
Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion table. One line for every Fahrenheit and corresponding Celsius value. On Fahrenheit value and its corresponding Celsius value should be separate by tab ("\t")
Constraints :
0 <= S <= 80
S <= E <=  900
0 <= W <= 40 
Sample Input 1:
0 
100 
20
Sample Output 1:
0   -17
20  -6
40  4
60  15
80  26
100 37
Sample Input 2:
20
119
13
Sample Output 2:
20  -6
33  0 
46  7
59  15
72  22
85  29
98  36
111 43
Explanation For Input 2:
We need need to start calculating the Celsius values for each of the Fahrenheit Value which starts from 20. So starting from 20 which is the given Fahrenheit 
start value, we need to compute its corresponding Celsius value which computes to -6. We print this information as <Fahrenheit Value> a tab space"\t"
<Celsius Value> on each line for each step of 13 we take to get the next value of Fahrenheit and extend this idea till we reach the end that is till 119 
in this case. You may or may not exactly land on the end value depending on the steps you are taking.

Problem5:
Calculator

Write a program that performs the tasks of a simple calculator. The program should first take an integer as input and then based on that integer perform the task as given below.
1. If the input is 1, 2 integers are taken from the user and their sum is printed.
2. If the input is 2, 2 integers are taken from the user and their difference(1st number - 2nd number) is printed.
3. If the input is 3, 2 integers are taken from the user and their product is printed.
4. If the input is 4, 2 integers are taken from the user and the quotient obtained (on dividing 1st number by 2nd number) is printed.
5. If the input is 5, 2 integers are taken from the user and their remainder(1st number mod 2nd number) is printed.
6. If the input is 6, the program exits.

Problem 6:
Reverse of a number

Write a program to generate the reverse of a given number N. Print the corresponding reverse number.
Note : If a number has trailing zeros, then its reverse will not include them. For e.g., reverse of 10400 will be 401 instead of 00401.


Input format :

Sample Output 2 :
891

Soln
def reverse(n):
  test_num = 0
  while (n > 0):
    remainder = n % 10
    test_num = (test_num * 10) + remainder
    n = n // 10
  return(format(test_num))
	

n=int(input())
result = reverse(n)
print(result)

Problem 7 :
Palindrome number

Write a program to determine if given number is palindrome or not. Print true if it is palindrome, false otherwise.
Palindrome are the numbers for which reverse is exactly same as the original one. For eg. 121
Sample Input 1 :
121
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
1032
Sample Output 2 :
false

Soln:

def checkPalindrome(num):
    temp = num
    rev = 0
    while (num > 0):
        dig = num % 10
        rev = rev * 10 + dig
        num = num // 10
    if temp == rev:
        f = True
    else:
        f= False
    return f


num = int(input())

Problem 8 :
Sum of even & odd
Send Feedback
Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
Digits mean numbers, not the places! That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.
Input format :
 Integer N
Output format :
Sum_of_Even_Digits Sum_of_Odd_Digits
(Print first even sum and then odd sum separated by space)
Constraints
0 <= N <= 10^8
Sample Input 1:
1234
Sample Output 1:
6 4
Sample Input 2:
552245
Sample Output 2:
8 15
Explanation for Input 2:
For the given input, the even digits are 2, 2 and 4 and if we take the sum of these digits 
it will come out to be 8(2 + 2 + 4) and similarly, if we look at the odd digits, they are, 5, 5 and 5
which makes a sum of 15(5 + 5 + 5). Hence the answer would be, 8(evenSum) <single space> 15(oddSum)
